Document and create a basic "paper" outline to visually understand the user interface for the 3D Escape Room Challenge game.
    - Outline the start menu, game menu, and settings
    - Plan the puzzles for each room

Having a proper UI outline allows the team to agree on the visuals, and different scenes for the game.
